# PC-Cooling-System
The goal of this project is to create a cooling mechanism to cool the pc when it reaches a certain temperature and moderates pc temperature. 
The following components used: 
Components:
DHT11 Temperature + Humidity - measure temp
Fan blade+ motor/pc cooling fan- provide cooling
4 digit 7 segment display - display the temperature 

Used an LCD display to notify the user when its on/of and display the temperature
Tested and on multiple PC and compared its cooling efficiency 
Documented data with multiple PC builds to track its effectiveness in certain temperature
